835 CAP/Interest Payments: Generate AMT Segment for Interest Payments to Populate in PLB


description
-----------

CARD:

As the Payer EDI Team
I need the summation of any and all AMT02 from the generated AMT segments for interest payments from the 2100 Loop ID at the Claim Level for ONE provider to be populated in to the PLB segment
So that the PLB04 is correct for balancing the claims amount to equal the BRN02.


 CONVERSATION:
High Level Requirements:
Ensure the AMT segment is generated when AMT01=I (AMT*I...)
All AMT*I amounts pulled from the E_REPOS.STG_835.INTEREST_AMOUNT and STG_835_CLP.INTEREST_AMOUNT.
All interest amounts from each AMT segment for multiple claims are correctly summed and placed in PLB.
Assumptions:

N/A         
 Constraints:

AMT segment from Service Line to NOT be included.
Dependencies:

N/A
 Risks:

N/A

CONFIRMATION:
 Acceptance Criteria:

The AMT segment is being generated with AMT01=I
ΣAMT02=PLB
Interest payments accurately displayed in PLB04
ΣCLP + PLB =BRN02
