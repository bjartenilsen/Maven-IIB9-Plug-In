NOTES:
------


11Dec2019 - JLI - Including this here in case I need to find it again, or someone else needs to. There seems to be related code in the old 5010 repo EDI_JAVA folder gov/va/med/hac/edi/era/jpa/ProcessERepos835Load.java under the comment: 
/* As per story US8657 - hard-coded email address for 835 out-bound */

That being said, there seems to be an incongruity between what the code looks at and the properties files. The code looks like it wants a property named BUSINESS_EMAIL_ID in file resources/dbhibernate.properties, but in the dbhibernate.properties file only the property PAYER_EMAIL_ID is set (it's set to the email given in the user story, though). Probably a typo, easily addressed.
