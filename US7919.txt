STORY: 835CAP - 01.01.01: Retrieve FMS Doc ID

As a Claims Processor, I want to retrieve FMS Doc IDs for Central Fee so that our transactions can be processed.

Acceptance Criteria: Verify that the fixed length data is pulled in . This value shall be stored in the Fee_Claim_Payment_Lines table in the column “TRN02_835” on FPPS_Owner schema.


5/8 Team should know where the existing functionality is for us to completely validate. We also need sample FMS document. What value we need to put in 835_TRN02 and how do we match - FTC will reach out to AJ M to get info

STORY: 835CAP - 01.01.03: Reconciliation between payment via Fee_Claim_Payment and Fee_Claim_Payment_Lines

As a Claims Processor, I want to verify that claims in the Fee_Claim_Payment and Fee_Claim_Payment_Lines tables match the 835 being sent out so that our remittance advice is accurate.

Acceptance Criteria: Verify that the payments listed in the 835 to be sent out match those stored in the Fee_Claim_Payment and Fee_Claim_Payment_Lines on FPPS_Owner schema.
If the values match, then resolve reconciliation and send to E_REPOS Staging Table (STG_835_HDR_TRN) consistent with the Current State
If the values do not match, then error out consistent with the Current State
The 835 Process must now pull the value from TRN02_835 instead of Check Number
